OCI image registry deployment management & config.

How to deploy
-------------

`sourcecode` machine images are created via the [imgbuilder](../imgbuilder) framework, and
configured via [configmgmt](../configmgmt), just like other OSC platforms.

The easiest way to get `sourcecode` (and the rest of the OSC platform stack) up &
running for development/testing is to use the [OSC local infra
bootstrapper](../bootstrapper).

For production deployments, refer to the `infracode/` subdirectory for IaC
configurations/scripts.
