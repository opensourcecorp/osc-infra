Gaia Configurations for OpenSourceCorp Core
===========================================

This subdirectory houses actual deployments that leverage Gaia itself, to
provide core infrastructure for OpenSourceCorp. For example, under `aws/`, you
will find Gaia configurations for OSC's core AWS VPC/networking, etc. that the
entire platform uses, but that does not necessarily belong under another repo.
